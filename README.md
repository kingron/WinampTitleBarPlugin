# WinampTitleBarPlugin
A plugin for Winamp, I wrote it for myself, it control Winamp2.0 player by Hot key and dock Winamp window to active window


This plug-in makes Winamp's main window dock to whatever 
window you happen to be working in. It only docks when 
you are in Windowshade mode, and only after you have 
enabled the plug-in. To enable the plug-in, simply open 
Winamp, open the preferences, go the the Plug-ins General
Purpose section, select 'Kingron's Winamp TitleBar Control 
v0.2.0.9', and hit configure.
